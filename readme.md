Click here to visit Sports Scheduler Website

The Sports Scheduler app is a versatile tool that allows the management of different sports events and sessions. The app caters to two types of users - Admin and User.

The Admin has the privilege to create new sports and add sessions for each sport. The admin can also edit or delete players from each session. This feature makes it easier for the admin to manage the sports events efficiently.

The User can create a session only on sports that are already created by the Admin. They cannot create a new sport, and they can only edit the session created by them. This feature ensures that the User has limited access and can only modify their events.

The app provides a user-friendly interface that makes it easy to manage and track the sports events. The Admin can create and manage multiple sports, while the User can view and manage their specific events.
